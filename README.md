Blackjack game for playing as well as automating hands

To test the game itself, open Blackjack2.0.Web/Blackjack2.0TestPage.html.

If you run full automation, a .txt file is created storing the data from each hand. 
It is located in the local storage for Silverlight, which is hard to determine an exact location.
An example: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\Silverlight\is\glh1vn12.ytv\godz1fig.n30\1\s\almtkvv1x5oe1rbjyftaytiwtssjdgqaiz2o4jbfjgfrusew1jaaaega\f

You can copy and paste this data wholesale into the "Data interpreter.xls" file located in the main folder; it is comma delimited. 
If you can't figure out what it all means just ask.
